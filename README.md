This repository contains the Isabelle and MetiTarski codes to illistrate the use of 
formal computer based techniques to verify 
(1) the control theory and
(2) realtime testing of stability onboard, 
both of which support support the safe operation of an unmanned multi-rotor aircraft. 

Extensive  mathematical derivations, which have formerly been carried out manually, 
are checked for their correctness by use of the Isabelle code. Higher-order logic 
interactive theorem-provers and an automated theorem-provers are to be used when 
this code is run.
